# S3 VirusScan
This template creates a Antivirus cluster for S3 buckets. You can connect as many buckets as you like by using [S3 Event Notifications](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html). The template has it's own repository: [aws-s3-virusscan](https://github.com/widdix/aws-s3-virusscan)

## Features

* Uses ClamAV to scan newly added files on S3 buckets
* Updates ClamAV database every 3 hours automatically
* Scales EC2 instance workers to distribute workload
* Publishes a message to SNS in case of a finding
* Can optionally delete compromised files automatically
* Logs to CloudWatch Logs

## Installation Guide
Visit the template's repository for installation instructions: [aws-s3-virusscan](https://github.com/widdix/aws-s3-virusscan)

# Account Password Policy
This template creates an account password policy for your IAM users. You can:

* set IAM user passwords to be valid for only the specified number of days.
* prevent IAM users from reusing a specified number of previous passwords.
* specify the minimum number of characters allowed in an IAM user password.
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one lowercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a to z).
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one uppercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (A to Z).
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one numeric character (0 to 9).
* require that IAM user passwords contain at least one nonalphanumeric character.
* permit all IAM users in your account to use the IAM console to change their own passwords.
* prevent IAM users from choosing a new password after their current password has expired.

Or just use the suggested defaults.

If you want to use an external S3 bucket, the bucket needs to have the following S3 bucket policy:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailAclCheck",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::$ExternalTrailBucket"
  }, {
    "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailWrite",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "s3:PutObject",
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::$ExternalTrailBucket/AWSLogs/$AccountId[0]/*",
      "arn:aws:s3:::$ExternalTrailBucket/AWSLogs/$AccountId[1]/*",
      "arn:aws:s3:::$ExternalTrailBucket/AWSLogs/$AccountId[2]/*"
    ],
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
      }
    }
  }]
}

```

Replace `$ExternalTrailBucket` with the name of your bucket, and add a row for every account you want to write from `$AccountId[*]`.
